# Automation & Workflows

Workflow automation, triggers, actions, and intelligent automation rules.

## Current Status

**Maturity Level:** Planned (0% implementation)
**Target Timeline:** Q2-Q3 2026
**Priority:** Medium-High (Critical for competitive differentiation)

### What Exists Today

- ✅ Basic campaign sequences (linear email flows)

- ✅ Time-based delays between emails

- ✅ Campaign scheduling

- ✅ Manual campaign triggers

### What's Missing

- ❌ Visual workflow builder

- ❌ Conditional logic and branching

- ❌ Event-based triggers (beyond time)

- ❌ Behavioral automation

- ❌ Multi-path workflows

- ❌ AI-powered optimization

- ❌ Workflow templates

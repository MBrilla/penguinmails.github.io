# Queue & Background Jobs

Background job processing, queue monitoring, and notifications.

## MVP Status

**Current State**: Core email pipeline and background jobs active

**What's Ready**:

- Email Pipeline (PostgreSQL + Redis) - ACTIVE

- Background Jobs (job processing) - ACTIVE

- High throughput (10,000+ emails/minute)

- At-least-once delivery guarantee

- Smart throttling and retry logic

- Multiple queue priorities

**What's Working**:

- Email sending jobs processed reliably

- Campaign processing and analytics aggregation

- Warmup scheduling and health checks

- Queue monitoring and metrics

See [Queue Roadmap](/docs/features/queue/roadmap) for future enhancements.

## Features in This Category

### Available Now

#### [Core Email Pipeline](/docs/features/queue/email-pipeline)

PostgreSQL + Redis queue system for high-throughput email processing.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **High Throughput**: Process 10,000+ emails/minute

- **Reliable Delivery**: At-least-once delivery guarantee

- **Smart Throttling**: Respect provider and warmup limits

- **Dynamic Content**: Personalization injection

- **Automatic Retries**: Exponential backoff for failed jobs

- **Dead-Letter Queue**: Failed job handling

- **Per-Tenant Rate Limiting**: Enforce tenant-specific limits

- **Per-Node Throttling**: Warmup-aware throttling

- **Stateless Workers**: Horizontal scaling support

**Status**: ACTIVE | **Priority**: Critical

#### [Background Jobs](/docs/features/queue/background-jobs)

Job processing system for asynchronous tasks.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Job Types**: email.send, campaign.process, import.contacts, export.data, webhook.dispatch, maintenance.cleanup

- **Priority-Based Processing**: High-priority jobs processed first

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Complete jobs before shutdown

- **Stalled Job Detection**: Re-queue stalled jobs automatically

- **Idempotent Design**: Safe to retry jobs

- **Queue Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard

- Workflow orchestration

- Scheduled recurring jobs

- Job chaining

- Conditional execution

**Status**: Future Enhancement | **Priority**: Low

#### Notification System

In-app and email notifications for users.

**Planned Capabilities**:

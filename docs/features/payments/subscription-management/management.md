## Upgrading Your Plan

**Scale up as your business grows** - prorated billing ensures you only pay for what you use.

### How to Upgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Change Plan**
2. Select higher-tier plan
3. Review **prorated cost** for current billing period
4. Confirm upgrade
5. Immediate access to new features

### Proration Calculation

**Example:** Upgrade from Starter ($49/mo) to Professional ($149/mo) on day 15 of 30-day month:

```text
Days remaining in period: 15 days
Professional daily rate: $149 / 30 = $4.97/day
Starter credit: $49 / 30 = $1.63/day × 15 = $24.50
Upgrade cost: ($4.97 - $1.63) × 15 days = $50.10

Total charged today: $50.10
Next billing (full month): $149.00
```

**Benefits of Upgrading:**
- Immediate access to higher limits
- Pro-rated billing (fair pricing)
- Unlock advanced features instantly
- No downtime or service interruption

## Downgrading Your Plan

**Reduce costs if your needs change** - changes take effect at end of current billing period.

### How to Downgrade

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Change Plan**
2. Select lower-tier plan
3. Review **impact on usage limits**
4. Acknowledge data/feature limitations
5. Confirm downgrade
6. Changes effective **next billing cycle**

### Important Downgrade Considerations

**What Happens When You Downgrade:**
- Usage Limits Reduced - Next billing cycle
- Feature Access Lost - Advanced features disabled
- Data Retained - No data loss, but access restricted
- Exceeded Limits - Must remove excess before downgrade

**Pre-Downgrade Checklist:**
- Check current usage vs new plan limits
- Remove excess team members if needed
- Archive or delete excess workspaces
- Disable features not in lower plan
- Backup data if concerned

**Example:** Downgrade from Professional (5 users, 10 workspaces) to Starter (2 users, 3 workspaces):

**Required Actions:**
1. Remove 3 team members (keep 2)
2. Delete or archive 7 workspaces (keep 3)
3. Downgrade takes effect next billing date

### How to Cancel

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Cancel Subscription**

4. Confirm cancellation

# Contact Privacy

Respect privacy of email contacts (not just platform users) through proper rights management and data security.

## Contact Privacy Rights

### GDPR Rights for Contacts (EU Residents)

Contacts who are EU residents have the following rights under GDPR:

- **Right to access data** - Request copy of all data held about them
- **Right to rectification** - Correct inaccurate or incomplete data
- **Right to erasure** - Request deletion of their data
- **Right to data portability** - Receive data in portable format
- **Right to object to processing** - Opt out of data processing activities

### How Contacts Exercise Rights

The process for contacts to exercise their privacy rights:

1. **Contact the tenant** - Contact reaches out to email sender (your customer)
2. **Tenant requests from PenguinMails** - Via admin panel data management tools
3. **PenguinMails fulfills request** - Export, correct, or delete contact data
4. **Confirmation provided** - Tenant notifies contact of completed action

## Contact Data Security

### Tenant Isolation

Contact data is isolated at multiple levels to prevent unauthorized access:

**Tenant isolation** ensures contacts are visible only to the owning tenant. No tenant can access another tenant's contact data.

**Workspace isolation** provides optional workspace-level separation within tenants for organizations that need departmental data boundaries.

### Data Protection

**Encrypted storage** applies the same encryption standards used for user data to all contact information.

**Access logging** maintains audit trail of all contact data access, enabling compliance verification and incident investigation.

## Privacy Impact Assessments

Evaluate privacy risks for new features and processing activities involving contact data.

### When PIA Required

- New feature involving personal data
- Changes to data processing
- New third-party integration

### PIA Process

1. **Identify data flows** - Map data collection and sharing
2. **Assess necessity** - Justify data collection
3. **Evaluate risks** - Privacy and security risks
4. **Mitigation measures** - Technical and organizational safeguards
5. **Documentation** - Record PIA findings
6. **Review** - Regular reassessment

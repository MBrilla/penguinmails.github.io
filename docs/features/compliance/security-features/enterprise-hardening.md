# Enterprise Security Hardening

Advanced network security and encryption for enterprise deployments.

## Network Security

### IP Whitelisting

- **Admin Access**: Restrict platform admin access to specific corporate IPs/VPNs
- **API Access**: Tenant-level IP allowlists for API key usage
- **SMTP Relay**: Dedicated IP pools for high-volume senders

### Advanced Protection

- **DDoS Mitigation**: Enterprise-tier protection for high-availability requirements
- **WAF Rules**: Custom Web Application Firewall rules for specific tenant needs

## Advanced Encryption

### Key Management

- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMEK)**: Allow enterprise tenants to manage their own encryption keys (BYOK)
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)**: Integration for highest-assurance key storage

### Data Isolation

- **Tenant Encryption**: Unique encryption keys per tenant for strict data isolation
- **Encrypted Backups**: Tenant-specific encrypted backup storage

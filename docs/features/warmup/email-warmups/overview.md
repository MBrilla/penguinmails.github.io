# Email Warm-up Overview

Most cold email campaigns fail not because of poor messaging, but because emails never reach the inbox. Email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook use sophisticated algorithms to filter emails, and new accounts start with zero reputation. Our automated warm-up system transforms zero-reputation email addresses into trusted senders that achieve 95%+ inbox placement within 21 days.

## Business Impact

Poor deliverability costs companies an average of $420,000 annually in lost revenue. Our warm-up system delivers 3-5x improvement in deliverability rates and 50-70% increase in campaign response rates.

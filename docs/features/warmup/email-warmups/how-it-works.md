# How Email Warm-up Works

Our intelligent warm-up system uses proven deliverability patterns refined through thousands of campaigns to build your sender reputation automatically.

## Intelligent Automated Progression

Unlike manual warm-up processes that often fail, our system follows a data-driven progression pattern:

| Phase | Days | Daily Volume | Focus |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Foundation** | 1-3 | 5-10 emails | Build initial reputation |
| **Establishment** | 4-7 | 10-25 emails | Establish sending patterns |
| **Growth** | 8-14 | 25-50 emails | Scale gradually |
| **Optimization** | 15-21 | 50-100 emails | Optimize for capacity |
| **Full Capacity** | 22+ | Based on engagement | 95%+ deliverability |

Volume limits are determined by engagement, not arbitrary numbers. See our [deliverability myths guide](/guides/deliverability-myths-debunked) for details.

## Smart Monitoring and Protection

### Automatic Safeguards

Warm-up automatically slows or pauses if key health indicators move outside safe ranges. This prevents reputation damage before it occurs.

### Health-Based Progression

Sending volume increases are guided by observed performance trends, not fixed schedules. The system adapts to your specific account characteristics.

### Reputation Signals

- Combines internal performance data with external signals where appropriate
- Uses signals on a sensible cadence rather than unrealistic constant checks
- Provides transparent explanations of behavior changes

### Transparent Behavior

Customers see clear explanations of why warm-up behavior changes. For example: "We are slowing down because recent performance indicates increased risk."

## Performance and Reputation Dashboard

### Warm-up Progress

Visual tracking of how accounts move through warm-up stages. See exactly where you are in the process.

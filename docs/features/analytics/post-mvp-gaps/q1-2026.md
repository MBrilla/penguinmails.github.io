# Q1 2026 - Enhanced Analytics

Enhanced analytics features building on MVP foundation with predictive insights, custom dashboards, and advanced segmentation.

**Timeline:** Q1 2026 (9-12 weeks total)

## 1. Predictive Analytics

**Description:** AI-powered predictions for send time optimization, subject line performance, deliverability forecasting, and churn risk identification

**Why Post-MVP:** Requires 30+ days of historical data from MVP phase and ML infrastructure setup. Core analytics must be stable before adding predictive capabilities.

**Complexity:** Large (3-4 weeks)

### User Impact

- Automated send time optimization per contact
- Subject line performance prediction before sending
- Deliverability forecasting to prevent issues
- Churn risk identification for retention actions

### Business Value

- Improve campaign ROI by 35% through AI optimization
- Reduce deliverability issues through predictive monitoring
- Increase retention through proactive churn prevention
- Competitive advantage through AI-powered insights

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integrate Gemini AI API for predictive analytics
- [ ] Implement send time optimization (per-contact predictions)
- [ ] Build subject line performance prediction with recommendations
- [ ] Create deliverability forecasting model (inbox placement prediction)
- [ ] Develop churn prediction model with retention action recommendations
- [ ] Integrate predictions into analytics dashboard
- [ ] Provide confidence scores for all predictions
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering and response parsing
- [ ] Add fallback handling for API failures

### Dependencies

- 30+ days of historical campaign data
- Gemini AI API access and configuration
- Prompt engineering for analytics use cases
- Historical data export pipeline
- API error handling and fallback logic

## 2. Custom Dashboard Builder

**Description:** Drag-and-drop dashboard builder with custom widgets, metrics, and white-label support for agencies

**Why Post-MVP:** Advanced feature for power users and agencies. Standard dashboards sufficient for MVP. Requires widget library development and dashboard persistence layer.

**Complexity:** Large (3-4 weeks)

### User Impact

- Create personalized analytics views
- Build client-specific dashboards for agencies
- Define custom metrics and KPIs
- White-label dashboards for client reporting

### Business Value

- Increase platform stickiness through customization
- Enable agency use cases with client dashboards
- Differentiate from competitors with flexibility
- Support diverse user needs and workflows

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create dashboard builder UI with drag-and-drop interface
- [ ] Implement widget library (metric cards, charts, tables, funnels)
- [ ] Support custom metric definitions with formula builder
- [ ] Allow dashboard saving and sharing (per-user and per-workspace)
- [ ] Implement dashboard templates for common use cases
- [ ] Support white-label branding for agency dashboards
- [ ] Add dashboard export (PDF, PNG)
- [ ] Implement real-time widget updates

### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- Widget component library
- Dashboard persistence layer (database schema)
- Drag-and-drop library (react-grid-layout)

## 3. Advanced Segmentation Analytics

**Description:** Behavioral and predictive segmentation with performance analysis by segment

**Why Post-MVP:** Requires ML models and extensive data analysis. Basic segmentation sufficient for MVP. Advanced segmentation enables sophisticated targeting strategies.

**Complexity:** Large (3-4 weeks)

### User Impact

- Analyze performance by industry, company size, job title
- Identify high-performing segments automatically
- Create predictive segments (likely to convert, churn risk)
- Get segment-specific optimization recommendations

### Business Value

- Improve targeting precision and campaign ROI
- Enable sophisticated segmentation strategies
- Identify high-value customer segments
- Optimize resource allocation by segment performance

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create segment performance analysis view
- [ ] Implement behavioral segmentation (highly engaged, at-risk, champions)
- [ ] Build predictive segmentation (likely to convert, churn risk, high LTV)
- [ ] Show performance metrics by segment (open rate, click rate, conversion rate)
- [ ] Provide segment-specific optimization recommendations
- [ ] Support custom segment creation with rule builder
- [ ] Implement segment comparison view
- [ ] Add segment export functionality

### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- Lead scoring system
- ML-based segmentation models
- Segment definition engine

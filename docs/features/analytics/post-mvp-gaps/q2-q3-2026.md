# Q2-Q3 2026 - Advanced and Enterprise Analytics

Advanced analytics, infrastructure optimization, and enterprise-grade capabilities.

## Q2 2026 - Advanced Analytics

### 4. Multi-Touch Attribution

**Description:** Advanced attribution modeling (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based) for revenue tracking across customer journey

**Why Post-MVP:** Complex feature requiring CRM integration and customer journey tracking. Basic ROI tracking sufficient for MVP. Enterprise customers need multi-touch attribution for accurate ROI calculation.

**Complexity:** Large (4-5 weeks)

#### User Impact

- Understand complete customer journey
- Attribute revenue across multiple touchpoints
- Compare attribution models for accuracy
- Calculate true campaign ROI

#### Business Value

- Accurate ROI calculation for enterprise customers
- Multi-channel attribution for complex journeys
- Data-driven budget allocation decisions
- Justify marketing spend with attribution data

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Build attribution engine supporting 5 attribution models
- [ ] Implement customer journey tracking across all touchpoints
- [ ] Create attribution visualization (journey map, touchpoint timeline)
- [ ] Calculate revenue attribution by campaign and touchpoint
- [ ] Support custom attribution model creation
- [ ] Integrate with CRM for conversion tracking
- [ ] Provide attribution comparison view (model vs model)
- [ ] Add attribution export for external analysis

#### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- CRM integration
- Customer journey tracking system
- Revenue tracking and conversion events

### 5. Large-Scale Data Processing Investigation

**Description:** Investigate and implement solutions for large-scale analytics data processing as platform scales

**Why Post-MVP:** Current PostHog + manual database cleanup sufficient for MVP. Investigation needed when data volume or query complexity exceeds current capabilities.

**Complexity:** Medium (2-3 weeks for spike + implementation)

#### User Impact

- Faster analytics queries (sub-second response times)
- Support for complex multi-step ETL workflows
- Historical data analysis without performance degradation
- Custom aggregations beyond PostHog capabilities

#### Business Value

- Maintain performance as platform scales
- Enable advanced analytics features
- Support enterprise data volumes
- Optimize infrastructure costs

#### Triggers for Investigation

- Analytics queries taking >5 seconds
- Database storage exceeding 500GB for analytics data
- Complex multi-step ETL requirements
- PostHog limitations for custom aggregations

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conduct spike to evaluate data processing needs and volume projections
- [ ] Analyze PostHog and OLAP database limitations
- [ ] Evaluate scalable data processing solutions
- [ ] Assess database cleanup strategies and archival requirements
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks and cost analysis
- [ ] Create recommendation report with implementation plan
- [ ] Implement chosen solution if spike validates need
- [ ] Migrate complex analytics queries to optimized processing layer

#### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- 3+ months of production analytics data
- Performance metrics and bottleneck analysis

## Q3 2026 - Enterprise Analytics

### 6. Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration

**Description:** Integration with enterprise data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for real-time data sync

**Why Post-MVP:** CSV/Excel/JSON export sufficient for MVP. Real-time data warehouse integration requires enterprise customer validation and infrastructure investment.

**Complexity:** Large (3-4 weeks)

#### User Impact

- Stream analytics data to data warehouses in real-time
- Integrate with BI tools for live dashboards
- Build custom analytics in external systems
- Synchronize data across enterprise infrastructure

#### Business Value

- Enable enterprise data integration workflows
- Support custom analytics in external tools
- Differentiate with real-time capabilities
- Unlock enterprise customer segment

#### Triggers for Investigation

- 3+ enterprise customers requesting data warehouse integration
- Real-time streaming requirements
- Compliance requirements for data residency

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conduct spike to validate enterprise customer demand (3+ customers)
- [ ] Build WebSocket/SSE server for real-time data streaming
- [ ] Implement data warehouse connectors (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- [ ] Support streaming of campaign events (sent, opened, clicked, bounced)
- [ ] Provide streaming API with authentication and rate limiting
- [ ] Support custom data transformations in stream
- [ ] Add stream monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Provide client SDKs (JavaScript, Python)

#### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- Large-scale data processing spike results
- WebSocket infrastructure
- Enterprise customer validation

### 7. Cohort Analysis

**Description:** Track customer lifecycle, retention, and behavior by cohort for product and growth teams

**Why Post-MVP:** Advanced analytics feature for mature products. Requires 6+ months of historical data. Basic retention metrics sufficient for MVP.

**Complexity:** Medium-Large (2-3 weeks)

#### User Impact

- Analyze user retention by signup cohort
- Track engagement trends over time
- Calculate lifetime value by cohort
- Identify churn patterns across cohorts

#### Business Value

- Understand customer lifecycle and retention
- Optimize onboarding and engagement strategies
- Calculate accurate lifetime value
- Identify successful cohort characteristics

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create cohort analysis view with retention matrix
- [ ] Support cohort definition by signup date, first campaign, or custom event
- [ ] Show retention curves by cohort
- [ ] Calculate cohort-based engagement trends
- [ ] Implement lifetime value tracking by cohort
- [ ] Identify churn patterns across cohorts
- [ ] Support cohort comparison (cohort A vs cohort B)
- [ ] Add cohort export for external analysis

#### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete
- Historical data (6+ months minimum)
- Cohort definition system
- Retention calculation engine

### 8. In-House Transactional Email System

**Description:** Replace Loop.so with central SMTP server for transactional emails (report delivery) to reduce costs

**Why Post-MVP:** Cost optimization feature. Loop.so sufficient for MVP. In-house system requires SMTP infrastructure and template management development.

**Complexity:** High (2-3 weeks)

#### User Impact

- No user-facing changes (transparent migration)
- Continued reliable report delivery
- Potential for faster delivery with dedicated infrastructure

#### Business Value

- Cost savings: $29/month → $0
- Full control over delivery infrastructure
- Eliminate third-party dependency
- Leverage existing SMTP infrastructure

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Build central SMTP server for transactional emails
- [ ] Implement template management system for reports
- [ ] Add delivery tracking and analytics
- [ ] Migrate scheduled report delivery to in-house system
- [ ] Implement bounce and complaint handling
- [ ] Add email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Deprecate Loop.so integration
- [ ] Monitor delivery rates and reputation

#### Dependencies

- Core analytics complete

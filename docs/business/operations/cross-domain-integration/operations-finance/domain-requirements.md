### Financial Data Flow Integration

Data flows between operations and finance follow real-time synchronization:

```
Financial Activities ──┐
                      ├──► Operations Processing ──► Financial Optimization
Cost Data ─────────────┘                            │
                                                  ▼
Operations Insights ◄─── Financial Analytics ◄─── Performance Metrics
```

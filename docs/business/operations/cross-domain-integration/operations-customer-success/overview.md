# Operations-Customer Success Integration Overview

This document establishes comprehensive operations-customer success integration requirements, defining data flows, process coordination, workflow synchronization, and cross-domain optimization between operations and customer success domains.

## Strategic Value

Operations-customer success integration enables seamless coordination between operational processes and customer success initiatives, driving customer health optimization, retention improvement, and expansion acceleration.

## Document Structure

This integration framework is organized into focused modules:

1. **[Domain Requirements](/docs/business/operations/cross-domain-integration/operations-customer-success/domain-requirements)** - Health monitoring, retention operations, and expansion pipeline requirements
2. **[Process Workflows](/docs/business/operations/cross-domain-integration/operations-customer-success/process-workflows)** - Customer health, intervention coordination, and success measurement
3. **[Technology Integration](/docs/business/operations/cross-domain-integration/operations-customer-success/technology-integration)** - Technology stack, data synchronization, and API architecture
4. **[Success Metrics](/docs/business/operations/cross-domain-integration/operations-customer-success/success-metrics)** - KPIs, business value measurement, and implementation roadmap

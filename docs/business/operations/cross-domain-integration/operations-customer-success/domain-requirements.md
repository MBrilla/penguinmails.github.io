# Operations-Customer Success Domain Requirements

Comprehensive integration requirements for customer success operations, health monitoring coordination, retention automation, and expansion pipeline optimization.

## Customer Success Operations Integration

### Customer Success Workflow Integration

- **Customer Health Monitoring**: Health scoring, early warning systems, and predictive analytics coordination
- **Retention Operations**: Churn prevention automation, intervention coordination, and recovery processes
- **Expansion Pipeline Operations**: Opportunity identification, scoring optimization, and pipeline acceleration
- **Customer Onboarding Operations**: Success plan coordination, milestone tracking, and early success optimization
- **Success Measurement Operations**: KPI tracking, ROI measurement, and success attribution coordination

### Customer Success Data Flow Integration

Data flows between operations and customer success follow real-time synchronization:

```
Customer Activities ──┐
                      ├──► Operations Processing ──► Success Optimization
Health Indicators ─────┘                          │
                                               ▼
Operations Insights ◄─── Success Analytics ◄─── Performance Metrics
```

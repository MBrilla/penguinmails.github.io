# Strategic Implementation Framework Overview

Executive oversight and strategic planning framework for email infrastructure deployment with realistic scope and resource intelligence.

## Scope Clarification

- **MVP Phase (2025)**: Basic infrastructure and directional analytics
- **Post-MVP Phase (2026+)**: Advanced features like real-time monitoring, AI optimization, and enterprise capabilities

Advanced features like WebSockets, AI-powered automation, and enterprise integrations are planned for Post-MVP implementation.

## Document Structure

This implementation framework is organized into focused modules:

1. **[Implementation Phases](/docs/business/implementation/implementation-roadmap/phases)** - Foundation, Growth, and Enterprise phase details
2. **[Investment Framework](/docs/business/implementation/implementation-roadmap/investment)** - ROI intelligence and resource planning
3. **[Risk and Migration](/docs/business/implementation/implementation-roadmap/risk-migration)** - Risk management and provider migration
4. **[Success Factors](/docs/business/implementation/implementation-roadmap/success-factors)** - Technical requirements, metrics, and IP reputation

## Strategic Implementation Summary

| Phase | Duration | Monthly Investment | Expected ROI |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Foundation** | 2-4 weeks | $20-25 | 200-400% |
| **Growth** | 4-8 weeks | $150-200 | 300-500% |

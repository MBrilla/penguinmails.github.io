# Financial Services Compliance Framework

Regulatory compliance forms the foundation of all financial services marketing activities. This guide covers securities, banking, and anti-money laundering requirements essential for marketing teams.

## Regulatory Requirements

### Securities Compliance (SEC)

Marketing compliance requires systematic verification across all investment-related communications:

- All investment recommendations include proper risk disclosures
- Performance advertising follows Rule 206(4)-1 guidelines
- Testimonials comply with FINRA Rule 2210 requirements
- No material misrepresentations or omissions in marketing materials
- Anti-fraud provisions compliance (Rule 10b-5)

### Banking Regulations

Key banking regulations affecting marketing communications include:

**Truth in Lending Act (TILA):** Requires accurate cost disclosures for credit products, ensuring consumers understand the true cost of borrowing before making decisions.

**Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA):** Mandates clear settlement cost information for real estate transactions, preventing hidden fees and surprise charges.

**Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):** Governs fair lending and community investment requirements, ensuring financial institutions serve all segments of their communities.

**Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):** Protects consumer credit information and governs how credit data can be used in marketing activities.

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Considerations

AML requirements affect customer acquisition and marketing processes:

**Know Your Customer (KYC):** Customer identity verification requirements must be factored into onboarding processes and marketing communications about account opening.

**Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers requires different marketing approaches for different customer segments.

**Suspicious Activity Reporting:** SAR filing requirements for suspicious transactions affect how marketing and sales teams handle unusual customer behavior.

**Sanctions Screening:** OFAC and international sanctions compliance requires screening customer data before marketing engagement.

## Content Guidelines

### Investment Marketing Claims

All investment marketing must meet substantiation requirements:

- Performance claims must be based on actual account performance
- Hypothetical performance requires prominent hypothetical disclaimers
- Benchmarks must be appropriate and clearly labeled
- Risk disclosures must be prominently displayed
- Performance periods must be representative, not cherry-picked

### Fee Transparency Requirements

Fee disclosure requirements ensure customers understand total costs:

**All-in Fee Disclosure:** Marketing materials must present total cost including all fees and expenses, not just headline rates.

**Ongoing Fee Structure:** Clear explanation of recurring charges helps customers understand long-term cost implications.

**Fee Impact Analysis:** Showing how fees affect long-term investment returns helps customers make informed decisions.

**Comparison Benchmarking:** Fee comparison with industry averages provides context for value assessment.

## Compliance Process Integration

### Legal Review Workflow

Establish mandatory legal review for all client-facing materials. Create clear escalation paths for time-sensitive marketing needs while maintaining compliance standards.

### Training Programs

Regular compliance training for marketing teams ensures ongoing awareness of regulatory requirements. Annual certification programs demonstrate organizational commitment to compliance.

### Vendor Management

All marketing vendors must understand financial regulations applicable to their work. Include compliance requirements in vendor contracts and conduct regular vendor compliance audits.

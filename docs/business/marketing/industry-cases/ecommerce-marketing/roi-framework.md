## ROI Calculation Framework

### Basic ROI Formula

```markdown
MVP E-commerce Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (Revenue from Marketing - Marketing Investment) / Marketing Investment × 100
```

### Customer Lifetime Value Calculation

```markdown
MVP Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Order Value) × (Purchase Frequency) × (Customer Lifespan) × (Profit Margin)
```

---

## Example ROI Calculation

### Scenario Parameters

```markdown
Monthly Marketing Investment: $30,000
New Customers Acquired: 500
Average Order Value: $75
Monthly Purchase Frequency: 1.1
Customer Lifespan: 18 months
Profit Margin: 20%
```

### CLV Calculation

```markdown
CLV = $75 × 1.1 × 18 × 0.20 = $297
```

### ROI Calculation

```markdown
Monthly Revenue from New Customers = 500 × $297 = $148,500
ROI = ($148,500 - $30,000) / $30,000 × 100 = 395%
```

### Interpretation

- Each dollar invested generates $3.95 in customer lifetime value
- Payback period: Less than 1 month
- Strong positive ROI indicates healthy marketing efficiency

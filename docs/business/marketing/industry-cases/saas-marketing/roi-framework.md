# SaaS Marketing ROI Framework

Metrics, implementation checklist, success benchmarks, and Post-MVP roadmap for SaaS marketing.

## MVP SaaS ROI Metrics

### MVP Growth Metrics
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Basic predictable monthly subscription revenue
- **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** Basic annualized subscription revenue
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Basic total revenue from customer relationship
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Basic marketing and sales cost per customer

### MVP Retention Metrics
- **Monthly Churn Rate:** Basic percentage of customers lost each month
- **Basic Revenue Retention:** Revenue retention including expansions and contractions
- **Logo Retention:** Basic percentage of customer accounts retained
- **Basic Cohort Analysis:** Customer behavior and retention by acquisition cohort

### MVP Expansion Metrics
- **Basic Dollar Retention:** Revenue growth from existing customers
- **Expansion Revenue:** Basic additional revenue from customer expansions
- **Upsell Rate:** Basic percentage of customers who upgrade to higher tiers
- **Cross-sell Success:** Basic additional products sold to existing customers

## MVP ROI Calculation Framework

```
MVP SaaS Marketing ROI Formula:
ROI = (CLV - CAC) / CAC × 100

MVP Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:
CLV = (Average Monthly Revenue per Customer) × (Gross Margin %)

MVP Payback Period:
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin)
```

### MVP Example ROI Calculation

```
Monthly Marketing Investment: $60,000
New Customers Acquired: 150
Average Monthly Revenue per Customer: $400
Gross Margin: 75%
Monthly Churn Rate: 7%

Customer Lifetime Value = ($400 × 0.75) / 0.07 = $4,286
Customer Acquisition Cost = $60,000 / 150 = $400
ROI = ($4,286 - $400) / $400 × 100 = 972%
Payback Period = $400 / ($400 × 0.75) = 1.33 months
```

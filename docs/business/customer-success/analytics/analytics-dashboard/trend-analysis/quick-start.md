# Trend Analysis Quick Start Guide

This guide provides role-based navigation paths for the trend analysis framework.

## For Customer Success Managers

Start with [Customer Health Score Trends](./multi-dimensional-trends.md#customer-health-score-trends-framework) → [Risk Pattern Recognition](./anomaly-detection.md#health-score-anomaly-detection) → [Intervention Timing](./implementation-impact.md#real-time-analytics-implementation) → [Account-Specific Insights](./seasonal-patterns.md)

## For Data Scientists

Focus on [Advanced Analytics](./advanced-analytics.md#correlation-and-relationship-analysis) → [Anomaly Detection](./anomaly-detection.md#automated-anomaly-identification) → [Predictive Modeling](./advanced-analytics.md#trend-forecasting-and-predictive-analytics) → [Statistical Validation](./advanced-analytics.md#cross-metric-relationship-mapping)

## For Strategic Planners

Prioritize [Business Impact Analysis](./implementation-impact.md#strategic-value-measurement) → [Market Trends](./seasonal-patterns.md) → [Seasonal Patterns](./seasonal-patterns.md#industry-specific-seasonality-framework) → [Strategic Forecasting](./advanced-analytics.md#predictive-trend-modeling)

## For Operations Teams

Review [Real-time Monitoring](./multi-dimensional-trends.md#real-time-health-monitoring) → [Operational Metrics](./multi-dimensional-trends.md#customer-lifetime-value-clv-evolution-analysis) → [Process Optimization](./implementation-impact.md#batch-processing-framework) → [Performance Tracking](./implementation-impact.md#roi-and-business-impact)

## Framework Overview

| Component | Purpose | Primary Users |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Multi-Dimensional Trends | Health score tracking at multiple timeframes | CS Managers, Analysts |
| Seasonal Patterns | Industry-specific seasonality analysis | Strategic Planners |
| Anomaly Detection | Automated alerting and risk identification | Operations, CS Managers |
| Advanced Analytics | Correlation and predictive modeling | Data Scientists |
| Implementation | Architecture and business value | Engineers, Executives |

## Key Capabilities

# Advanced Analytics and Insights

## Correlation and Relationship Analysis

### Cross-Metric Relationship Mapping

```yaml
Correlation Analysis Framework:
  Health Score Correlations:
    - Usage pattern correlation with health score changes
    - Support interaction quality impact on health trends
    - Feature adoption correlation with customer satisfaction
    - Stakeholder engagement correlation with health outcomes
  
  Revenue Impact Correlations:
    - Health score correlation with expansion opportunity identification
    - Usage pattern correlation with upsell and cross-sell success
    - Engagement quality correlation with revenue growth
    - Competitive positioning correlation with market share
  
  Predictive Correlation Models:
    - Multi-variate correlation analysis and modeling
    - Leading indicator identification and validation
    - Predictive model feature importance and optimization
    - Time-lag correlation analysis and forecasting
```

### Statistical Methods

| Method | Use Case | Accuracy Target |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Pearson Correlation | Linear relationships | >0.7 correlation coefficient |
| Time-Series Analysis | Trend forecasting | >85% prediction accuracy |
| Regression Modeling | Multi-factor impact | R² > 0.75 |
| Cluster Analysis | Segment identification | Silhouette score > 0.6 |

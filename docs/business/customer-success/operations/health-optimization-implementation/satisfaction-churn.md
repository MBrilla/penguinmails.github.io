# Customer Satisfaction and Churn Prevention

Implementation procedures for systematic customer satisfaction measurement and proactive churn prevention strategies.

## Customer Satisfaction Analysis

### NPS Survey Implementation

**Survey Cadence**:

- **Quarterly NPS Survey**: All active customers (>90 days tenure)
- **Post-Onboarding Survey**: Day 30 after initial activation
- **Post-Support Survey**: After critical support ticket resolution
- **Pre-Renewal Survey**: 60 days before contract renewal date

**Survey Response Analysis Workflow**:

1. **Promoters (9-10)**: Identify advocacy and expansion opportunities
2. **Passives (7-8)**: Engage for feedback and improvement opportunities
3. **Detractors (0-6)**: Immediate CSM outreach within 24 hours
4. **Non-Responders**: Follow-up outreach after 7 days

**Detractor Response Protocol**:

1. **Immediate Contact** (Within 24 hours): CSM reaches out to understand concerns
2. **Root Cause Analysis** (Within 48 hours): Document specific pain points and issues
3. **Action Plan** (Within 72 hours): Develop targeted resolution strategy
4. **Executive Escalation** (If needed): Engage leadership for high-value accounts
5. **Follow-up Survey** (30 days): Measure satisfaction improvement after intervention

## Churn Prevention Tracking

### At-Risk Account Management Process

**Identification Phase** (Ongoing):

- Automated health score monitoring flags at-risk accounts (<70 score)
- Weekly CSM review of usage decline patterns
- Payment issue alerts from finance integration
- Support ticket sentiment analysis for frustration indicators

**Assessment Phase** (Week 1):

1. Review complete account history and health score trends
2. Analyze usage patterns to identify specific decline triggers
3. Review support ticket history for unresolved pain points
4. Assess contract renewal timeline and revenue at risk
5. Determine intervention priority based on revenue impact and save probability

**Intervention Phase** (Weeks 2-4):

1. **Immediate Outreach**: Schedule call with key stakeholder within 48 hours
2. **Discovery Call**: Understand current challenges and changing needs
3. **Solution Development**: Create customized action plan addressing root causes
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assign technical support, training, or product resources
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Weekly check-ins to track improvement

**Resolution Phase** (Weeks 5-8):

1. Confirm health score recovery to stable range (>70)
2. Document successful intervention strategies for playbook
3. Establish ongoing engagement cadence to prevent future decline
4. Transition to standard account management with monthly monitoring
5. Share learnings with CSM team for continuous improvement

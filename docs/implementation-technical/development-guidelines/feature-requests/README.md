# Feature Request Process

This section provides comprehensive guidance for submitting feature requests, understanding the approval workflow, implementing features according to standards, and following quality guidelines for PenguinMails development.

## Quick Navigation

| Guide | Focus | Audience |

| [Development Guidelines](./guidelines) | Code organization, quality gates, launch checklists | Developers, QA |

## Feature Request Workflow Overview

The feature request process follows a structured workflow from initial submission through release:

1. **Submission**: Contributors submit feature requests using the standardized template
2. **Community Discussion**: Ideas are discussed and refined with community input
3. **Maintainer Review**: Technical feasibility and resource requirements assessed
4. **Roadmap Planning**: Approved features are prioritized and scheduled
5. **Implementation**: Development follows coding standards and testing requirements
6. **Review & Testing**: Code review, testing, and quality gate validation
7. **Release**: Phased rollout with monitoring and feedback collection

## Key Principles

**Problem-Solution Fit**: Every feature request must clearly identify the problem being solved and the users who benefit.

**Technical Feasibility**: Implementation complexity, database changes, API modifications, and security implications must be assessed before approval.

**Quality Gates**: Features must pass comprehensive testing, security review, and documentation requirements before merging.

**Phased Rollout**: New features use feature flags for controlled release, starting with beta users before general availability.

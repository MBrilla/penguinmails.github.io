# Security & Privacy Integration Framework Overview

Unified security and privacy framework ensuring comprehensive data protection and regulatory compliance across all PenguinMails system components.

## Strategic Alignment

This framework supports our enterprise compliance strategy by providing regulatory compliance and risk mitigation, establishing market leadership through comprehensive data protection, privacy-by-design architecture, and integrated security excellence.

Technical authority: Our integrated security infrastructure combines comprehensive monitoring systems featuring real-time threat detection, automated compliance reporting, enterprise-grade encryption, and privacy-by-design implementation.

Backed by enterprise security and privacy platforms with 99.9% compliance uptime, advanced threat monitoring, automated incident response, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Document Structure

This framework is organized into focused modules:

1. **[Security Architecture](/docs/compliance-security/enterprise/security-privacy/security-architecture)** - Core security principles, data protection, and access control
2. **[Privacy Program](/docs/compliance-security/enterprise/security-privacy/privacy-program)** - Privacy by design, data subject rights, and compliance
3. **[Incident Response](/docs/compliance-security/enterprise/security-privacy/incident-response)** - Detection, response, and recovery procedures
4. **[Vendor Security](/docs/compliance-security/enterprise/security-privacy/vendor-security)** - Third-party risk management and business continuity

## Core Security Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Defense in Depth | Multiple layers of security controls |
| Least Privilege | Minimum access necessary for operations |
| Zero Trust | Continuous verification of all access requests |
| Privacy by Design | Security integrated into system architecture |
| Incident Response | Rapid detection and remediation of security events |
